# CrackDetection
Created a machine learning model using PyTorch that would detect cracks on road from on open source road dataset. The ML model would predict a masked model relative to the ground truth mask.

Below is the public repository for the dataset

https://github.com/biankatpas/Cracks-and-Potholes-in-Road-Images-Dataset 

The machine learning model uses semantic segmentation algorithm with a pre-trained model. Below is the repository for where the pre-trained segmentation model was obtained

Below are some examples of output from the model. A sample of the output images can be found in the ML_Output folder
