# CrackDetection
Created a machine learning model using Pytorch that would detect cracks on road from on open source road dataset

Below is the public repository for the dataset

The machine learning model uses semantic segmentation algorithm with a pre-trained backbone. Below is the repository for where the pre-trained segmentation model was obtained
