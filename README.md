# CrackDetection
Created a machine learning model using Pytorch that would detect cracks on road from on open source road dataset. The ML model would predict a masked model relative to the ground truth mask.

Below is the public repository for the dataset

The machine learning model uses semantic segmentation algorithm with a pre-trained model. Below is the repository for where the pre-trained segmentation model was obtained
